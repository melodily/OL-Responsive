			<p>
				What happens if we take the best of the best and ask them to teach us how they've done it? We'll set up a camera, give them a marker, and throw them in front of a whiteboard. Then we'll take that footage and make it available to the world - for free.

			<h3 class="current">Philosophy</h3>
			<p>
				Everyone at <span class="openlectures"><b>open</b>lectures</span> shares two things in common: an intimate grasp of their subject matter, and a fervent passion for sharing their knowledge. Everyone works <i>pro bono</i>, after office hours, and on weekends. Everyone loves what they're doing.

			<h3 class="current">Mission</h3>
			<p>
				There's a hundred other e-learning alternatives we can name. Schools use them as supplementary material. Us? We're more than supplements, we're replacements. Look for us if you miss a class, then go back and join up without a worry in the world.

			<h3 class="current">Quality</h3>
			<p>
				We've got crazy dedication to quality. Our lectures are checked, peer-checked, then quality-checked. What makes us sure we're teaching the correct thing? We're just sharing what we've learnt.

			<h4><span class="openlectures"><b>open</b>lectures</span> aims to build a platform for students to learn in a manner complementary to their schooling.<br/> We want to return the power of learning to individuals, instead of leaving it to a system that is not tailored to suit everyoneâ€™s needs.</h4>
			<br/>
			<p>Education should not be limited by wealth or the ability to afford it. It should be accessible to everyone who wants to learn. We believe that education should be based on learning, not studying; sharing, not teaching. We are motivated to give back by sharing our experience and expertise with students who want to better themselves by learning. Everyone here contributes based on that principle. Think of it as getting the best tutors you could possibly find, anytime, anywhere, and at zero cost.</p>

	<h2>The Production Line</h2>
	<p>At least six hours of work goes into a single lecture. Here's what happens when we roll up our sleeves and get down to work.</p>

			<p>In the first stage of planning, we gather a team of students with tremendous exposure and experience in the subject matter. We sit down for coffee. Many rounds of coffee. Our lecturers get comfortable saying no to each other.</p>
		</div><!--3col-->	
		<div class="span3">
			<h4 class="aligncenter">Storming</h4>
			<p>It all starts with an outline. What goes in, what stays out, what's unclear. Everyone looks at that outline, then it's what's good, and what sucks. Fifteen to twenty revisions later, we have a list of lectures.</p>
		</div><!--3col-->	
		<div class="span3">
			<h4 class="aligncenter">Norming</h4>
			<p>Allocation time. Our lecturers know what they know best, so we lay everything out <i>a la mode</i> buffet. Every lecture belongs to someone. From there, we work out the preparation material. More coffee.</p>
		</div><!--3col-->	
		<div class="span3">
			<h4 class="aligncenter">Performing</h4>
			<p>We go down to headquarters at a top secret location. The on-site support team awaits. There's this big, scary camera they use to do the recording. The footage is edited and corrected, then sent for quality checks.</p>
