			<h4 class="subheader"><strong>Executives</strong></h4>
			<p class="medium remove-bottom">Linan Qiu</p>
			<p><strong>Founder and Chief Executive Officer</strong></p>
			<p>Linan's job is to make irresistable offers and y'know, run the company. A student at Columbia University, he has somehow managed to make the entire team work for free. He cites his Communist roots. Linan leads the design of the <span class="openlectures"><strong>open</strong>lectures</span> service and development of its core infrastructure.</p>
			<p>Zhang Yitao</p>
			<p><strong>Founder and Chief Financial Officer</strong></p>
			<p>Yitao sells ice to the eskimos and charges them a delivery fee. He makes his home somewhere in-between Stanford University and Silicon Valley, where he acquires and applies his vast experience in entrepreneurship. He leads the finance, internationalization and facilities aspects of life as our staff know it.</p>
			<p class="medium remove-bottom">Lim Mingjie, Kenneth</p>
			<p><strong>Chief Information Officer</strong></p>
			<p>Being CIO means Kenneth manages the running code riot that powers the <span class="openlectures"><strong>open</strong>lectures</span> site. He is responsible for the myriad of "ghetto" techniques that deliver lectures from behind the scenes. All crazy concepts are copyright him.</p>
			<p class="medium remove-bottom">Law Kang Jie</p>
			<p><strong>Chief Communications Officer</strong></p>
			<p>Kang Jie talks to everyone. When he's done with them, they normally fall irrevocably in love with what we do here. A man with a preference for all things creative, ask him about fashion when you meet him.</p>
			<p class="medium remove-bottom">Tek Yong Jian</p>
			<p><strong>Chief Operating Officer</strong></p>
			<p>Yong Jian started out as the one-man video editing team. While his responsibilities have expanded to include the day-to-day aspects of the company, he still makes it a point to go over every minute of footage just to ensure that sound and video look professional. He does not own much of a computer.</p>
			<p class="medium remove-bottom">Lee Cheng Feng Gary</p>
			<p><strong>Chief Academic Officer</strong></p>
			<p>Gary commands our veritable formation of lecturers, and provides the overall direction for development of content. He oversees curriculum planning, manpower matters and "anything else". He is currently single and available.</p>
