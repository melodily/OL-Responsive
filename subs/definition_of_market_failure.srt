Hi my name is Penghui and today I'll talk about Market Failure.

2
00:00:04,053 --> 00:00:06,000
So let's start with the definition of Market Failure.


3
00:00:09,382 --> 00:00:10,180
It is the situation that happens when 

4
00:00:10,181 --> 00:00:14,054
the allocation of goods and services by the free market is inefficient.

5
00:00:15,056 --> 00:00:17,330
This means that benefits are not maximized 

6
00:00:17,705 --> 00:00:21,088
based on the combination of goods and services that are currently in place.

7
00:00:21,784 --> 00:00:23,092
So this implies that there can be 

8
00:00:23,652 --> 00:00:25,786
a better combination of goods and services such that 

9
00:00:26,158 --> 00:00:28,180
the benefits are actually maximized for the market. 

10
00:00:28,922 --> 00:00:32,875
So there are a couple of different types of market failure.

11
00:00:33,431 --> 00:00:38,179
Basically imperfect competition which are your monopolies, oligopolies and so on.

12
00:00:38,868 --> 00:00:42,471
Externalities which are your positive and negative externalities.

13
00:00:42,918 --> 00:00:43,643
and lastly public goods.

14
00:00:44,838 --> 00:00:46,868
So there are actually two more kinds of market failure 

15
00:00:47,015 --> 00:00:49,455
but I won't go into it because they're not in the H2 syllabus.

16
00:00:49,933 --> 00:00:53,088
That is information asymmetry and the bounded rationality theorem.
