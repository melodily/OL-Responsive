	<h2>Quality Checks</h2>
	<p>A lecture that comes off the production line is checked thoroughly. If we feel it's necessary to get another opinion, we'll even show it to people who are totally unfamiliar with the subject. This isn't just any other "user-generated content". This is the real stuff.

			<h3>The Subject Breakdown</h3>
			<p class="lead">Lectures are monitored throughout the entire process.</p>
			<p>Once a lecture has been <strong>filmed</strong>, it's cleaned up and passed to other lecturers for a look over. When all's good, it's <strong>uploaded</strong> and given a final review. We're conscious that what we see in earlier stages may differ from the web-friendly product. Once we're ready to unveil the lecture to the world, it's <strong>published</strong>.</p>
			<p>Sometimes we miss out a thing or two and it's only discovered after the lecture has been released. If it's possible for us to provide an explanation, we add it by the side. If the problem's severe, we take the entire lecture down straight away. Either way, we schedule a <strong>re-film</strong>, big or small.</p>
			<p>We receive many suggestions on topics to look into or new areas to expand into. When this happens, we work out how it'll fit and mark it <strong>KIV</strong> for when we've finished the current production sequence.</p>
