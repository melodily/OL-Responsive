			<p>Education should not be limited by wealth or the ability to afford it. It should be accessible to everyone who wants to learn. We believe that education should be based on learning, not studying; sharing, not teaching. We are motivated to give back by sharing our experience and expertise with students who want to better themselves by learning. Everyone here contributes based on that principle. Think of it as getting the best tutors you could possibly find, anytime, anywhere, and at zero cost.</p>
